## What is Currying?

Imagine you have a function that needs three numbers to work, like `add(a, b, c)`. Normally, you'd call it like `add(2, 3, 5)` and get the answer right away.

<RegularFunctionViz client:load />

Currying lets you break this into smaller steps—you can call `curriedAdd(2)` first, which gives you back a new function. Then you call that function with `(3)`, which gives you yet another function. Finally, you call that last function with `(5)` to get your answer. It's like passing ingredients one at a time instead of all at once!

<CurriedCarousel client:load />

Currying is particularly useful when you want to create specialized functions from more general ones. For example, you might create a `logWithPrefix` function by partially applying a logger with a specific prefix:

```javascript
const log = (prefix, message) => {
  console.log(`[${prefix}] ${message}`);
};

const logWithPrefix = (prefix) => (message) => log(prefix, message);

const logError = logWithPrefix("ERROR");
const logInfo = logWithPrefix("INFO");

logError("Something went wrong!"); // [ERROR] Something went wrong!
logInfo("Process completed"); // [INFO] Process completed
```

## Implementation

The key idea is to check if we have enough arguments yet. If we do, we call the original function. If not, we return a new function that "remembers" the arguments we've collected so far and waits for more. We keep doing this until we have all the arguments needed, then finally execute the function.

```javascript
function curry(func) {
  return function curried(...args) {
    if (args.length >= func.length) {
      return func.apply(this, args);
    } else {
      return function nextCurried(...args2) {
        return curried.apply(this, args.concat(args2));
      };
    }
  };
}

const add = (a, b, c) => {
  return a + b + c;
};

const curriedAdd = curry(add);
const result = curriedAdd(2)(3)(5);
console.log(result); // 10
```
